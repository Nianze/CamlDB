  STRING - A string
        ex: "Alex", "bob", "EVE", "fIONA", "BSDFJ DFJS:L", "'''"

  FLOAT - IEEE double-precision floating point, equivalent to C's double
        ex: 3.14, 2e+19, 2E+19, -31.5, -2e+19, -2E+19, 9e+0, 80E-1, 5.

  INT - 31-bit signed int (roughly +/- 1 billion) on 32-bit
        processors, or 63-bit signed int on 64-bit processors
        ex: 001, 3, -35, -00134

  BOOL - A boolean, written either true or false
        ex: true, false


CREATE TABLE
  Syntax:
    CREATE TABLE
    CREATE TABLE [table name]
    ([column name 1] [column type 1],
    [column name 2] [column type 2],
    ...
    [column name n] [column type n]);

  Syntax Rules:
    [table name]: case-sensitive; support use any string except for the
    built-in words reserved for instructions, such as INT, CREATE.
    If creating a table with the same name as existing table, CamlDB will
    warn the user and let the user to confirm whether he wants the old table
    to be overwritten.

    [column name]: case-sensitive; support use any string except for the
    built-in words reserved for instructions, such as INT, CREATE.
    [column type]: support 4 types: INT, FLOAT, STRING, BOOL


  Example:
    CREATE TABLE data (name STRING, hours FLOAT, score INT);
